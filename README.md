## Timeline PenTest

Planning – 1-2 Weeks: Includes the contract execution, initial deposit, scheduling of resources, and review/agreement of the project Rules of Engagement (ROE).

Execution – 2-3 Weeks: This phase is when active testing of all in-scope targets is set to occur – the length of this phase varies by project and is directly related to the size/scope of the assessment.

Analysis, Documentation, and Quality Assurance – 1 Week: Document preparation including the Executive Summary Report and Technical Findings Report. This phase may also include some minimal testing and manual interactions with the in-scope targets to validate findings identified during the original execution of the test or gather more detail.

Presentation of Findings – 1 Day: Scheduled after all documentation and QA is complete, this is the final step to review findings, address questions, and wrap up the project.
